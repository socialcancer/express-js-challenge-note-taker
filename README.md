## Description

Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and saved notes. This application uses Express.js as the backend system.

- As a small business owner I WANT to write and save notes.
- Built this application as a way to organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks.
- The main problem I am trying to solve is learning Express.js
- I learned how to use express.js in a development environment and also take and save notes.
