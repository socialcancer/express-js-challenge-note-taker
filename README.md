# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and saved notes. This application uses Express.js as the backend system.

- As a small business owner I WANT to write and save notes.
- Built this application as a way to organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks.
- The main problem I am trying to solve is learning Express.js
- I learned how to use express.js in a development environment and also take and save notes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When you open note taker you are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
- I am presented with a page with existing notes listed on the left.
- I enter a new note title and the note's text.
- Then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
- The User clicks on the save icon.
- The Note is I have entered is saved and appears in the left hand column.
